              behaviors is a core goal in neuroscience. Optogenetics is one
              large step toward achieving this goal, yet optical methods to
              control neural activity in behaving rodents have so far been
              limited to perturbing all light-sensitive neurons in a large
              volume. Here we demonstrate an all-optical method for precise
              spatial control and recording of neuronal activity in
              anesthetized and awake freely behaving mice. Photoactivation
              patterns targeted to multiple neuronal somata, produced with
              computer-generated holography, were transmitted to the mouse
              brain using a micro-objective-coupled fiber bundle. Fluorescence
              imaging through the same device, via epifluorescence, structured
              illumination, or scanless multipoint confocal microscopy, allowed
              imaging of neurons and recording of neuronal activity. The
              fiberscope was tested in mice coexpressing ChR2-tdTomato and
              GCaMP5-G in cerebellar interneurons, delivering near-cellular

              biocompatible single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as NIR II
              fluorescent imaging agents, we performed high-frame-rate video
              imaging of mice during intravenous injection of SWNTs and
              investigated the path of SWNTs through the mouse anatomy. We
              observed in real-time SWNT circulation through the lungs and
              kidneys several seconds postinjection, and spleen and liver at
              slightly later time points. Dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging
              through principal component analysis (PCA) was performed and
              found to greatly increase the anatomical resolution of organs as
              a function of time postinjection. Importantly, PCA was able to
              discriminate organs such as the pancreas, which could not be
              resolved from real-time raw images. Tissue phantom studies were
              performed to compare imaging in the NIR II region to the

              Examination of the feature sizes of a common NIR I dye

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: There have been two recent revolutionary advances in
              neuroscience: First, genetically encoded activity sensors have
              brought the goal of optical detection of single action potentials
              in vivo within reach. Second, optogenetic actuators now allow the
              activity of neurons to be controlled with millisecond precision.
              These revolutions have now been combined, together with advanced
              microscopies, to allow ``all-optical'' readout and manipulation
              of activity in neural circuits with single-spike and
              single-neuron precision. This is a transformational advance that
              will open new frontiers in neuroscience research. Harnessing the
              power of light in the all-optical approach requires coexpression
              of genetically encoded activity sensors and optogenetic probes in
              the same neurons, as well as the ability to simultaneously target
              and record the light from the selected neurons. It has recently
              become possible to combine sensors and optical strategies that
              are sufficiently sensitive and cross talk free to enable
              single-action-potential sensitivity and precision for both
              readout and manipulation in the intact brain. The combination of
              simultaneous readout and manipulation from the same genetically
              defined cells will enable a wide range of new experiments as well
              as inspire new technologies for interacting with the brain. The
              advances described in this review herald a future where the
              traditional tools used for generations by physiologists to study
              and interact with the brain-stimulation and recording
              electrodes-can largely be replaced by light. We outline potential
              future developments in this field and discuss how the all-optical
              strategy can be applied to solve fundamental problems in
              neuroscience. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review describes the
              nexus of dramatic recent developments in optogenetic probes,
              genetically encoded activity sensors, and novel microscopies,
              which together allow the activity of neural circuits to be
              recorded and manipulated entirely using light. The optical and
              protein engineering strategies that form the basis of this
              ``all-optical'' approach are now sufficiently advanced to enable
              single-neuron and single-action potential precision for
              simultaneous readout and manipulation from the same functionally
              defined neurons in the intact brain. These advances promise to

It remains                  unclear why such perturbations do not generate movements and                  if conditions exist under which they may evoke movements.

                 types contribute to brain circuit functions. A long-standing
                 question is whether it is possible to independently activate
                 two distinct neural populations in mammalian brain tissue.
                 Such a capability would enable the study of how different
                 synapses or pathways interact to encode information in the
                 brain. Here we describe two channelrhodopsins, Chronos and
                 Chrimson, discovered through sequencing and physiological
                 characterization of opsins from over 100 species of alga.
                 Chrimson's excitation spectrum is red shifted by 45 nm
                 relative to previous channelrhodopsins and can enable
                 experiments in which red light is preferred. We show minimal

                 melanogaster. Chronos has faster kinetics than previous
                 channelrhodopsins yet is effectively more light sensitive.

              present a novel approach for this field by utilizing disordered
              light within a standard multimode optical fibre for lensless
              microscopy and optical mode conversion. We demonstrate the
              modalities of bright- and dark-field imaging and scanning
              fluorescence microscopy at acquisition rates that allow
              observation of dynamic processes such as Brownian motion of
              mesoscopic particles. Furthermore, we show how such control can
              realize a new form of mode converter and generate various types
              of advanced light fields such as propagation-invariant beams and
              optical vortices. These may be useful for future fibre-based
              implementations of super-resolution or light-sheet microscopy.",

  abstract = "Social interaction is a complex behavior essential for many
              species and is impaired in major neuropsychiatric disorders.
              Pharmacological studies have implicated certain neurotransmitter
              systems in social behavior, but circuit-level understanding of
              endogenous neural activity during social interaction is lacking.
              We therefore developed and applied a new methodology, termed
              fiber photometry, to optically record natural neural activity in
              genetically and connectivity-defined projections to elucidate the
              real-time role of specified pathways in mammalian behavior. Fiber
              photometry revealed that activity dynamics of a ventral tegmental
              area (VTA)-to-nucleus accumbens (NAc) projection could encode and
              predict key features of social, but not novel object,
              interaction. Consistent with this observation, optogenetic
              control of cells specifically contributing to this projection was
              sufficient to modulate social behavior, which was mediated by
              type 1 dopamine receptor signaling downstream in the NAc. Direct
              observation of deep projection-specific activity in this way
              captures a fundamental and previously inaccessible dimension of
              mammalian circuit dynamics.",

              each of these factors and introduce an experimental geometry
